# Next JS Backend

## Project Description

**Next JS Backend** is a straightforward repository crafted to facilitate the exploration and comprehension of backend concepts within the Next.js framework. This project serves as a foundational learning ground, enabling the implementation of essential backend functionalities in a Next.js environment.

## Key Concepts Explored:

1. **Defining Basic Routes and HTTP Calls:** Establishing fundamental routes and making HTTP calls within the Next.js backend to handle various functionalities.

2. **Familiarizing with NextRequest and NextResponse:** Gaining proficiency in working with NextRequest and NextResponse objects, pivotal components for handling incoming requests and generating responses.

3. **Accessing Dynamic Data from URL:** Learning how to dynamically fetch and handle data from the URL, allowing for flexible and parameterized routing within the Next.js backend.

4. **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE Calls (Rest API):** Implementing RESTful API functionality by incorporating common HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

5. **Middleware:** Understanding and implementing middleware to execute additional processing logic between the incoming request and the ultimate response.

6. **Request Limiter:** Implementing a request limiter to control and manage the rate of incoming requests, enhancing the backend's security and stability.

7. **CORS Allowed Origins:** Configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to specify which origins are permitted to access resources from the server.

8. **Wrapper to HTTP Calls:** Creating a wrapper to streamline and encapsulate HTTP calls, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
